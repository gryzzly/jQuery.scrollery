[jQuery.scrollery](http://gryzzly.github.com/jQuery.scrollery)

Very simple jQuery plugin that allows to create a photo-film like
gallery from a scrollable list of images.

version 0.1 – initial commit
version 0.2 – scrollery is trying to be smart and find out if images are already loaded or not. if not, it waits till all the images have loaded.
